# GenomeFeaturesOverlap
Python functions and scripts for finding overlap between genomic features files in different formats

Overview:
    -OverlapFunctions.py contains general functions for finding overlaps as well as reading and writing output
    -The _TestCase folder contains a test script and input files for OverlapFunctions.py

Notes:
    -I plan to add a _scripts folder in the future which will contains scripts for running overlaps on specific files
